# code-quiz-app

This application was created to learn VueJS. Pre-development, I've read on best VueJS practices from many resources such vuejs.org, Vue In Action, and other vuejs forums. This application shows the knowledge on VueJS in one week of development.

Mistakes I've made and how I improved:

 - Initially, I used my knowledge on object reference to invoke methods in the child components. However, I ended up using VueJS reactive state management.
This made my code much cleaner, and less prone to referencing errors, and give better performance.
